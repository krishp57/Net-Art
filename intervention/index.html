    <h1>Minecraft Web Intervention</h1>
<img src="interventionpic.png" alt="Image of Intervention">

<p>This web intervention takes place in the popular online game "Minecraft" and specifically a game within an online server called "Build Battle" where players are tasked to build the best version of a given prompt. My intervention ignores the prompt of the game and calls user's attention to the humanitarian crisis occuring in Gaza, by builing a large sign that reads "Help Gaza". As Minecraft has a huge, diverse playerbase, the intervention will reach a wide range of users. I hope this small act brings attention to those suffering and impacts some of the users playing, whether through them getting involved in the cause, donating, or spreading awareness themselves. </p>
