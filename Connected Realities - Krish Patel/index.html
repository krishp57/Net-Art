            <p>This exhibition explores the world of net art, and specifically dives into works that inhabit the digital space and display a deep connection with our own realities. Each piece selected for this show demonstrates how artists uniquely use the internet to create interesting art, that invokes thought and intrigue into audiences about their own lives. These artworks all challenge traditional notions about art, and reflect the creativity and interconnectedness of the internet. By bringing together a diverse number of net art works, the show intends to display the many ways in which the internet fosters new forms of creativity and a connection to our own lives. The exhibition aims to allow viewers to explore the ways in which digital spaces are connected with our personal realities and how they themselves can express themselves using digital art.</p>
